                <h3>Hudson Valley Geology Project</h3>
                <img src="project1.jpeg" alt="Project 1 Thumbnail">
                <p>The point and idea of this project was to create a historical timeline/ story for how different 
                    rock structures around the hudson valley were formed. This provides a helpful
                context for what we stand on and how the area is where it is today!</p>

                <h3>Geologic History of Maine</h3>
                <object data="Bedrock geologic map of Maine.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
                    <p>Unable to display PDF file. <a href="https://digitalmaine.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=mgs_maps">Download</a> instead.</p>
                  </object>
                <p>In this project my task was to map out and tell the story of 
                    the formation of Maine, name geologic structures
                and discoveries, map formation of volcanoes, faults, major events. Overall this 
                was a stressful project but very cool when it was done!</p>

                <p>I don't know where to begin with the bass, it has done a lot for me.
                    Through picking up an instrument it has given me a new outlet to express
                    myself, a similar outlet in a way to coding or art. In a way to me music
                    has become a language, not one with words but one with expression of any emotion.

                <p>This Project was a great experience for me, I never knew how websites really worked or 
                    how they were constructed. Now, through this class, I am Web Developement Certified and 
                    super happy that I took this class! I would recommend this class for literally everybody
                    because, it isn't really scary in the end, instead I would say it is a great form of expression 
                    and a helpful life skill!!</p>
